            I'm passionate about building mechanical keyboards. Building keyboards is a creative outlet where I get to experiment with different switches and keycaps to design something unique and tailored to my preferences. It's like building legos, but with the added satisfaction of creating a functional tool I use everyday.
            <br /><br />
            When I'm not building keyboards, you can find me rock climbing-especially bouldering. I enjoy the challenge of solving the climbing problem and the grit required to finish a climb. I also enjoy videography. I love capturing moments through a lens. Each of these hobbies bring a unique form of creativity to my life.
